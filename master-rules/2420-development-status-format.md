# Development Status Directives

**Reference:** `Core/Controllers/Methods/Guides/Memory Management/Procedures/Updating Memory Bank Files.md`

## Content Management

- **MAINTAIN** an accurate and up-to-date "Current State" section that reflects the actual, current state of the project.
- **UPDATE** the "Next Actions" section continuously, moving completed items to other sections as appropriate.
- **DOCUMENT** new challenges and open questions as they arise and remove them once resolved.
- **CROSS-REFERENCE** all status updates with the corresponding `Development Log` file to ensure consistency.

# Writing Style

## Core Principles
All writing must be:
- **Direct & Authoritative**: Use factual statements in an active voice.
- **Concrete & Actionable**: Provide examples and clear, actionable steps.
- **Concise & Efficient**: Make points without unnecessary build-up, words, or jargon.
- **Complete & Helpful**: Provide all necessary information for the context.

## Guidelines & Examples

- **Direct Communication Standard**: Use authoritative, factual statements.
  - **YES**: "MVC separates concerns into three components."
  - **NO**: "MVC isn't just a pattern but rather could be seen as a way to separate concerns."

- **Factual Presentation Format**: State concepts with concrete examples.
  - **YES**: "Abstraction creates clear interfaces while hiding implementation details."
  - **NO**: "One might consider abstraction as possibly creating interfaces that could potentially hide certain details."

- **Concise Explanation Protocol**: Make points without unnecessary build-up.
  - **YES**: "The Core Plugin architecture enables extensibility."
  - **NO**: "It's worth noting that, when considering extensibility, the Core Plugin architecture represents an approach that could be considered beneficial."

- **Implementation Guidance**: Provide actionable steps for implementation.
  - **YES**: "Implement authentication by: 1. Validating credentials 2. Generating token 3. Setting permissions"
  - **NO**: "Authentication should be implemented properly."

- **Verification Standard**: Include verification methods for important claims.
  - **YES**: "This approach reduces query time by 40% (verified by performance tests)."
  - **NO**: "This approach seems faster."

- **Banned Words**: NEVER use the words `transcend` or `holistic`, which are new-age jargon and not useful in technical writing.

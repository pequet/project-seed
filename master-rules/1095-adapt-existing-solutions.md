# Adapt Existing Solutions Protocol

- **ALWAYS PREFER ADAPTATION OVER RECREATION:** When faced with a task that has existing solutions, adapt and extend proven implementations rather than building from scratch.
- **IDENTIFY EXISTING PATTERNS:** Before starting development, search for existing scripts, utilities, or solutions that address similar problems (parameter validation, path handling, error management, etc.).
- **PRESERVE WORKING LOGIC:** When adapting existing code, maintain the core logic that already handles common edge cases and established patterns.
- **AVOID REINVENTION:** Do not recreate common utilities like argument parsing, path validation, or error handling when working implementations already exist.
- **DOCUMENT ADAPTATIONS:** When modifying existing solutions, clearly document what was changed and why, preserving the original working patterns.

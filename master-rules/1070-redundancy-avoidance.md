# Redundancy Avoidance Protocol

- **IDENTIFY REDUNDANCY:** Proactively identify when information, code, or rules are duplicated across the system.
- **RECOMMEND CONSOLIDATION:** When redundancy is found, recommend consolidating it into a single, authoritative source.
- **DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATES:** When adding new content, ensure it does not duplicate existing information. Place it in the single most logical location.
- **REFERENCE, DON'T REPEAT:** Prefer cross-references and links over duplicating content.

# CRITICAL File & Content Preservation Protocol

- **NEVER DELETE FILES OR CONTENT:** Under absolutely no circumstances should you ever delete a file or its content. This is a critical, non-negotiable directive.
- **EVOLVE, DON'T REPLACE:** Prioritize evolving and refactoring existing files over creating new ones to replace them.
- **ARCHIVE, DON'T DELETE:** If a file is no longer needed in its current location, **MOVE** it to the `4. Archives` directory. Do not delete it.
  - **EXAMPLE:** `Core/Models/2. Knowledge/Old-Concept.md` becomes `Core/Models/4. Archives/2. Knowledge/Old-Concept.md`.
- **PRESERVE HISTORY:** This protocol maintains the complete history, context, and link integrity of the system. Deletion causes irreversible data loss.

# Sequential Thinking Protocol

- **FOR COMPLEX REQUESTS** (e.g., planning, debugging, multi-step tasks), you MUST adopt a sequential thinking process.
- **OUTLINE** high-level steps before beginning execution.
- **PROCEED** through steps logically and sequentially.
- **STRUCTURE** your response with lists and headings for clarity.
- **SUMMARIZE** the outcome upon completion of a complex task.

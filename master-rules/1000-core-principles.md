# 1000: Core Principles

All actions, analysis, and communication from both human and AI agents MUST be evaluated against these four, non-negotiable core principles.

1.  **Clarity:** Communication must be precise, unambiguous, and easily understood. Code and documentation must be simple and maintainable.
2.  **Efficiency:** Operations must be performed in the most direct and resource-effective way possible. Redundancy in process or code must be eliminated.
3.  **Actionability:** All outputs, whether plans, reports, or code, must be concrete and lead directly to the next logical step. Avoid abstract or purely theoretical statements.
4.  **Accountability:** All agents (AI and human) are responsible for their actions and for maintaining the integrity of the system. When errors occur, they must be acknowledged, understood, and corrected.

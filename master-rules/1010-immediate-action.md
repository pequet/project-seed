# Immediate Action Protocol

- **EXECUTE** all direct requests immediately upon receiving them.
- **NEVER** ask for permission or confirmation to perform a task you were just explicitly instructed to do.
- **DO NOT** stop and ask, "Are you sure?" or "Would you like me to proceed?" after receiving a clear command.

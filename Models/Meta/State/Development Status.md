## Summary

The Seed Project provides a minimal starting point for implementing the framework. It includes the basic directory structure and essential files needed to begin building a knowledge base. This project is intentionally minimal to allow for organic growth based on specific needs. The recent addition of a Knowledge Roadmap template provides guidance on how to organize domain-specific knowledge as the project grows, supporting early planning for concept categorization and development.

## Accomplishments

- [x] Created basic project structure following MVC pattern (2025-03-10)
- [x] Set up state management files (2025-03-10)
- [x] Created initial Dashboard.md as entry point (2025-03-10)
- [x] Added welcome message to Inbox (2025-03-10)
- [x] Set up basic Views for Inbox, Concepts, and Dictionary (2025-03-10)
- [x] Added Knowledge Roadmap template for knowledge organization planning (2025-03-23)

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Basic Structure**
   - [x] MVC directory structure
   - [x] State management files
   - [x] Welcome message in Inbox
   - [x] Basic Views
   - [x] Knowledge planning template

## Next Actions

- [ ] Customize the Knowledge Roadmap template for a specific domain
- [ ] Define project-specific knowledge organization principles
- [ ] Implement metadata structure for domain concepts
- [ ] Develop specialized views for knowledge visualization
- [ ] Create analytical methods for knowledge processing

## Open Questions

- What domain-specific knowledge will this project organize?
- What metadata structure will best support this domain?
- What analytical methods will be most useful for this domain?
- How will the inbox be used to capture domain-specific insights?
- What knowledge domains should be included in the customized roadmap?

# Plan: Write README with Vibe-Tools Square

## 1. Goal

To generate a high-quality, publishable `README.md` for the boilerplate repository by leveraging the `Vibe-Tools Square` tool.

## 2. Rationale

We are phasing out our direct use of Vibe tools and want to lean heavily into using our own tool. This transition supports the goal of creating a professional, easy-to-use boilerplate while dogfooding our internal solutions.

## 3. Method

-   **Tool:** `Vibe-Tools Square`
-   **Query Type:** `repo`
-   **Action:** The tool will be executed to analyze the repository's structure and generate a draft of the `README.md`. The output will then be reviewed and refined.

## 4. Action Items

1.  Execute the `Vibe-Tools Square` tool with the `repo` query on the boilerplate directory.
2.  Review the generated `README.md` for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
3.  Refine the content, ensuring it links to the `000-Framework-Context.md` and `010-Development-Workflow.md` documents.
4.  Commit the final `README.md` to the repository.

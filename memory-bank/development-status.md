# Development Status

## Overall Status
The project is in the **initialization phase**. The core structure is in place, and the primary task is to populate the `memory-bank` with the specific context of the "Project Seed" boilerplate. The goal is to prepare the repository for its role as a public template for AI-assisted development.

## What Works
*   **Repository Structure:** The complete, MVC-style directory structure is in place and version controlled.
*   **Boilerplate Content:** The initial set of files, including the `memory-bank` templates and `master-rules`, exist and are ready for contextualization.
*   **Core Concept:** The project's goals, scope, and architecture are clearly defined in the updated `memory-bank` documents.

## What's Left
*   **Memory Bank Finalization:** The `development-log.md` needs to be updated to reflect the current session's work.
*   **AI Rules Review:** The `master-rules/` need a thorough review to ensure they are robust and clear.
*   **Core Documentation:** The main `README.md` and other user-facing documentation in `docs/` need to be written.
*   **Public Release:** The repository needs to be prepared and published as a public template on GitHub.

## Issues
*   No known technical issues at the moment. The primary challenge is ensuring the quality and clarity of the context and documentation being written.

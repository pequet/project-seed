# Memory Bank

This directory serves as the project's memory bank, documenting important project information, decisions, and progress. See `.cursor/rules/210-memory-bank.mdc` for the defined structure and usage guidelines.

**This directory is for internal project context and is generally not intended for public repositories.** While you can choose to include it publicly to showcase the project's methodology, it is recommended to add `memory-bank/` to your `.gitignore` file to keep it private.

## Why might you choose to release it in a public repository?

Three main reasons:

1.  **To Show the "Why":** The memory-bank is a complete history of the project's evolution. It documents not just what was built, but why it was built that way. This is valuable context for anyone who truly wants to understand or contribute to the project.
2.  **For Radical Transparency:** It's an honest, transparent look at the real process of software development, including the challenges and collaborative course-corrections made with an AI development partner.
3.  **Because It's Part of the "Product":** This project is not just a set of scripts, but a system of development where you and an AI collaborate. The memory-bank is a tangible artifact of that system.

Think of it as the project's "making-of" documentary. Feel free to explore if you're curious, but if you're just here to use the tool, you can safely focus on the main `README.md` and the root directory.

# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is the **initialization and contextualization of the project boilerplate**. The primary task is to systematically populate all files within the `memory-bank/` directory, moving them from their generic template state to a state that accurately reflects the purpose and structure of this "Project Seed" repository.

## Recent Changes
*   The project was recently restructured into its own `project-seed` directory to prepare for public release.
*   The initial phase of the memory bank update has begun, with `project-brief.md`, `product-context.md`, `tech-context.md`, `system-patterns.md`, and `project-journey.md` being updated with project-specific information.

## Next Steps

*   Complete the population of the `memory-bank` by updating the remaining files: `development-status.md` and `development-log.md`.
*   Conduct a full review of the `master-rules/` to ensure they are aligned with the project's goals.
*   Draft the initial version of the main `README.md` file.

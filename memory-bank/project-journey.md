# Project Journey

## Core Motivation

*   To create the most efficient, transparent, and powerful starting point for developing software with AI collaborators. We aim to empower developers to build better software faster by providing a framework that manages context and fosters a seamless human-AI partnership.

## Standard Project Milestones

Adapt the milestones below to fit your project and keep updating them as the project progresses.

**Phase 1: Conception & Setup**
- [x] M01: **Project Idea Defined & Motivation Documented:** The "Core Motivation" section above is filled out.
- [x] M02: **Environment Setup:** All required tools are installed and configured.
- [x] M03: **Version Control Init:** `git init` has been run and the repository is set up.
- [x] M04: **First Private Commit:** The initial project state has been committed locally.
- [x] M05: **Framework/Ruleset Established:** The core memory bank files and AI rules are in place.

**Phase 2: Core Development**
- [ ] M06: **Finalize AI Rules:** Complete the initial set of AI rules in `master-rules/`.
- [ ] M07: **Structure Documentation:** Create the initial `docs/` directory with user guides for the boilerplate.
- [ ] M08: **Draft Comprehensive README:** Write the first complete draft of the main `README.md` to serve as a guide for new users.
- [ ] M09: **Finalize README:** Refine and finalize the `README.md` based on internal review.
- [ ] M10: **Organize File Structure:** Ensure the file structure is maximally clear and easy to navigate for new users.

**Phase 3: Refinement & Testing**
- [ ] M11: **Create Validation Script:** Develop a test script to validate a new project's setup from the boilerplate.
- [ ] M12: **Internal Dogfooding:** Test the boilerplate by creating a new sample "hello-world" project from it internally.
- [ ] M13: **Document Memory Bank:** Create detailed documentation for each file in the `memory-bank` and its purpose.
- [ ] M14: **Refactor AI Rules:** Review and consolidate the `master-rules` for clarity, efficiency, and robustness.
- [ ] M15: **First User Feedback Session:** Have another developer use the boilerplate for a new project and provide feedback on the process.

**Phase 4: Release & Iteration**
- [ ] M16: **First Public Commit / Release Candidate:** The first version is ready for public view and consumption.
- [ ] M17: **README & Public Documentation Ready:** The project's public-facing documentation is complete and polished.
- [ ] M18: **Project Published/Deployed:** The project is published as a public template repository on GitHub.
- [ ] M19: **Address Post-Release Feedback/Bugs:** Fix issues and incorporate feedback reported by early adopters.
- [ ] M20: **Define Next Major Milestone:** Plan the next major version, potentially incorporating new AI tools or workflow improvements.

## Active Quests & Challenges

*   [ ] **Q1: Populate the Memory Bank:** Systematically update all files in the `memory-bank/` to reflect the boilerplate's true context (this is the current task).
*   [ ] **Q2: Review Master Rules:** Conduct a thorough review of the default `master-rules` to ensure they are sensible and effective.
*   [ ] **Q3: Get External Feedback:** Share the repository with a fellow developer and gather feedback on the clarity of the concept and documentation.

## Session Goals Integration (Conceptual Link)

*   Session-specific goals are typically set in `memory-bank/active-context.md`.
*   Completion of session goals that contribute to a milestone or quest here should be reflected by updating the checklists above.
*   Detailed narratives of completion and specific dates are logged in `memory-bank/development-log.md`.

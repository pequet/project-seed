# Seed Project Dashboard

## Overview

This Seed Project provides a minimal starting point for implementing the framework. It includes the basic directory structure and essential files needed to begin building a knowledge base.

## Getting Started

To start using this Seed Project:

1. Check the [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Models/Meta/State/Development Status|Development Status]] to see what's already set up
2. Review the [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Models/Meta/State/Development Log|Development Log]] to understand the project's history
3. Process the welcome message in your [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Views/0. Inbox/Inbox|Inbox]]
4. Define your project-specific knowledge organization principles
5. Start adding concepts to your knowledge base

For detailed instructions on creating a new project using this template, see the [[Core/Controllers/Methods/Guides/Project Management/Creating New Project|Creating New Project]] guide.

## Views

The Seed Project provides several basic views to get you started:

- [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Views/0. Inbox/Inbox|Inbox View]] - Manage your inbox items
- [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Views/2. Knowledge/Concepts|Concepts View]] - Browse all concepts in your knowledge base
- [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Views/2. Knowledge/Dictionary|Dictionary View]] - A comprehensive alphabetical listing of all knowledge elements

## Project Structure

The Seed Project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Models**: Where your knowledge and data live
  - `0. Inbox`: For capturing new ideas and information
  - `1. Projects`: For organizing project-specific knowledge
  - `2. Knowledge`: For storing domain knowledge
  - `Meta`: For system state management

- **Views**: Where you visualize and interact with your knowledge
  - `0. Inbox`: Views for managing inbox items
  - `2. Knowledge`: Views for exploring your knowledge base

- **Controllers**: Where your methods and processes live
  - `Methods`: For storing project-specific methods

## Next Steps

As you develop your project, consider:

1. Defining your domain-specific knowledge organization principles
2. Implementing a metadata structure for your concepts
3. Developing specialized views for your knowledge
4. Creating analytical methods for processing your knowledge

See the [[Projects/Seed/project-seed/Models/Meta/State/Development Status|Development Status]] for more specific next actions.
